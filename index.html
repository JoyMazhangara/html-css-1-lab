          <h1>Everybody Always: Becoming Love in a World Full of Setbacks and Difficult People</h1>
          <h2>By Bob Goff</h2>
          <p>In his entertaining and inspiring follow-up to the New York Times bestselling phenomenon "Love Does
              , <br/> Bob Goff takes readers on a journey into the secret of living without fear, contsraint, or worry.
              The path <br/>toward the liberated existence we all long for is found in a truth as simple to say as it 
              is hard to <br/>do: love people, even the difficult ones, without distinction and without limits.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Driven by Bob's trademark storytelling, "Everybody, Always" revels the lessons Bob<br/>
              learned--often the hard way--about what it means to love without inhibition, insecurity, or restriction.<br/>
              From finding the right friends to discovering the upside of failure, "Everybody, Always" points
              the <br/>way to embodying love by doing the unexpected, the intimidating, the seemingly
              impossible. Whether <br/>losing his shoes while skydiving solo or befriending a Ugandan witch doctor, Bob
              steps into life with<br/> a no-limits embrace of others that is as infectious as it is extraordinarily ordinary.
              "Everybody, Always" <br/>reveals how we can do the same.
